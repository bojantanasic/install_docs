### Pre-installation:

* Make sure you are on latest stable OneUI 5.0 or 5.1 firmware installed.
* crDroid Recovery (from downloag page, gapps button).
* I recommend to use MindTheGAPPS if want to run with gapps (see download page, gapps button).


### First time installation (clean flash):

* Reboot into crDroid recovery by (Vol Up + Power buttons with the device connected to your USB port.).
* Run "Factory reset" > "Format data/factory reset" > "Format Data".
* Tap on "Apply Update" > "Apply from ADB" .
* On your PC, open terminal and type the following command to flash;

```
adb sideload crdroid.zip
```

* Do the sideload steps for gapps and magisk too.
* Enjoy the fun ...

*You can also watch a "How to flash from scratch" [YouTube guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS7hOlN4uz0)*

###  Dirty flash  via recovery:
* On your computer open Command Prompt or Terminal and go to ADB folder location
* Reboot into Recovery using adb reboot recovery
* In crDroid Recovery, go to Apply update - Apply from ADB
* After that execute this command:

```
adb sideload crdroid.zip
```

### Update installation:
#### Via OTA:
* Use Updater to update to latest version. Gapps (if installed) are being kept
* Go to Settings -> System -> Updater and download latest build
* Choose install and let it finish
* After OTA update finished, don't reboot yet, go to Magisk, press on Install and install to Inactive Slot (After OTA)
* Reboot
